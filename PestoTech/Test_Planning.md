### Part 1: Test Planning

#### Test Strategy Document

**Objectives of Testing:**

- Ensure the e-commerce website functions correctly and meets business requirements.
- Verify that the website provides a smooth and error-free user experience.
- Identify and fix defects before deployment.
- Ensure performance and security standards are met.

**Scope of Testing:**

- Functional testing of user registration, product search, adding items to the cart, checkout process, and order management.
- Non-functional testing including performance, usability, and security.
- Both frontend and backend testing.

**Testing Levels:**

- **Unit Testing:** Testing individual components or units of the code.
- **Integration Testing:** Testing combined parts of an application to ensure they work together.
- **System Testing:** Testing the complete and integrated software to evaluate the system's compliance with the requirements.
- **Acceptance Testing:** Testing the system with real-world scenarios to ensure it meets the business requirements.

**Testing Types:**

- **Functional Testing:** Validates the software system against the functional requirements.
- **Usability Testing:** Evaluates the user interface and user experience.
- **Performance Testing:** Ensures the application meets performance standards under expected load.
- **Security Testing:** Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures the system is secure from attacks.

**Entry and Exit Criteria:**

- **Entry Criteria:** 
  - Requirements are defined and approved.
  - Test environment is set up.
  - Test data is prepared.
- **Exit Criteria:**
  - All planned tests are executed.
  - Critical and high-priority defects are fixed.
  - Test summary report is prepared and reviewed.

**Test Environment and Tools:**

- **Environment:** Test environment should mirror the production environment as closely as possible.
- **Tools:** Selenium for functional automation, JMeter for performance testing, OWASP ZAP for security testing, Jira for bug tracking.

**Risk Analysis:**

- **Technical Risks:** Compatibility issues, integration challenges.
- **Business Risks:** Delays in release, high defect rates.
- **Mitigation Strategies:** Regular code reviews, continuous integration and testing, maintaining a risk register.
